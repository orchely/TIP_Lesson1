 Long story short, QoS in iOS 8 can lead to a crash with async NSOperations.
 This is a workaround that doesn't eliminate the risk of the crash but mitigates it by 99.9%.

 Same as `[NSOperationQueue addOperation:]` but with added safety.
 If _op_ returns `YES` for `isAsynchronous`, the operation will be retained for a period that
 extends beyond the lifetime of the operation executing to avoid a crash.
