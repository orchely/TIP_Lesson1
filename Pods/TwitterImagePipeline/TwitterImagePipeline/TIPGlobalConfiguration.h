#pragma mark Downloads

/**
 The maximum time (estimated) that a `TIPImagePipeline` will permit a download to continue after all
 associated `TIPImageFetchOperation` instances have been disassociated (from `cancel`).

 Since HTTP/1.1 does not support cancelling a request mid-flight without closing a connection,
 it is often more efficient to let a download complete so that the connection can be kept alive with
 its enlarged window sizes.

 Since SPDY and HTTP/2 support cancellation, if it can be detected that we are running over one of
 these modern protocols, we will always cancel the download when all associated
 `TIPImageFetchOperation` instances are disassociated (aka cancelled).

 Default == `3.0` seconds.
 `0.0` seconds (or negative) == disabled (all downloads will be cancelled and connections closed over
 HTTP/1.1)

 A block that will be called anytime an external opinion on the download bitrate is needed by a
 `TIPImagePipeline`.
 In particular, this block will be used to inform an image download on whether or not it should be
 cancelled or continue to download after it has disassociated from all related operations (via
 `cancel`).  It can be the case that there isn't enough information to determine the bitrate of a
 download from the bytes that have been downloaded at that point in time, so an outside opinion will
 be consulted to make the best choice.
 If the block is `NULL`, or returns a negative value, the estimated bandwidth will be treated as
 _unknown_.
 @note Reminder that bitrate is in _bits per second_ (aka _bps).
 To convert from _bytes per second_ (aka _Bps_) to _bps_, just multiply the _Bps_ by `8`.
